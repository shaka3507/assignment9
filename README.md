## Questions
1. Which seems better for creating the elements of the app: JS alone or JS with React?
Since we've haven't started using JSX, JS with React (using createElement) does not seem to have the same benefits. The syntax is hard to understand since the children prop can accept any number of elements to display which makes it somewhat less readable.
